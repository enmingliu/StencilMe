Stencil Augmented Reality System

## TODO

1. Detecting flat vertical or horizontal surface with ARKIT computer vision tools

2. Placing solid node onto detected surface with a solid color

3. Basic UI consisting of button (to place and lock in stencil on detected surface) and stencil selection (SnapChat style/bubble list)

4. UI for user choice of image from iPhone gallery or preselected list of stencils
