# SARS
Stencil Augmented Reality System

## TODO

1. Detecting flat vertical or horizontal surface with ARKIT computer vision tools

2. Placing solid node onto detected surface with a solid color

3. Basic UI consisting of button (to place and lock in stencil on detected surface) and stencil selection (SnapChat style/bubble list)

4. UI for user choice of image from iPhone gallery or preselected list of stencils

## Description

The Stencil Augmented Reality System (SARS) is an app that uses the iOS ARKit API to display a user image on a flat surface of their choice. Once the image appears on the surface, the user can adjust the opacity of the image and then trace it. This app removes the need to carry around or create physical stencils to replicate their hand-drawn images.
