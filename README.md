# StencilMe
Stencil Augmented Reality System

## Description

StencilMe is an app that uses the iOS ARKit API to display a user image on a flat surface of their choice. Once the image appears on the surface, the user can adjust the opacity of the image and then trace it. This app removes the need to carry around or create physical stencils to replicate their hand-drawn images.
