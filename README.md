# StencilMe
App that uses the iOS ARKit API to display a user image on a flat surface of their choice, removing the need to carry around or create physical stencils to replicate their hand-drawn images.

## Description

StencilMe is an app that uses the iOS ARKit API to display a user image on a flat surface of their choice. Once the image appears on the surface, the user can adjust the opacity of the image and then trace it. This app removes the need to carry around or create physical stencils to replicate their hand-drawn images.

## Next Steps

   1. Create backend API in order to curate online community dedicated to sharing stencils and art created with our app

   2. Polish frontend UI/UX and create a user facing interface to interact with our future StencilMe community
